# VoxelGame

A voxel-based 3D engine and sandbox game built in **C++** with **Vulkan**,
where you can explore, then fly to new worlds in space.
Designed for learning 3D rendering and game mechanics from the ground up!

## Features

- **Voxel Worlds:** Fully destructible and buildable cubic terrain.
- **Explore New Worlds:** Fly to newly generated worlds.
- **World Generation:** Fixed size worlds with caves, and biomes.
- **Physics:** Collisions, and basic rigid-body physics.
- **Real-time Rendering:** Built on Vulkan for high-performance GPU rendering.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Core Vulkan-based voxel engine
- [ ] Physics and collision system
- [ ] Terrain generation for fixed size world
- [ ] Lighting, shadows, and basic PBR materials
- [ ] Gameplay mechanics (building, mining, terraforming, spaceship)
- [ ] Fly and generate new worlds to expore
- [ ] Optimization and GPU performance improvements
- [ ] VR support (experimental)

## Getting Started
