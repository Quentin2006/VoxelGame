# VoxelGame

A voxel-based 3D engine and sandbox game built in **C++** with **Vulkan**,
where you can explore, build, and experiment with physics in a dynamic,
procedurally-generated universe. Designed for learning 3D rendering,
physics simulations, and game mechanics from the ground up!

## Features

- **Voxel World:** Fully destructible and buildable cubic terrain.
- **Procedural Generation:** Infinite worlds with caves, mountains, and rivers.
- **Physics Sandbox:** Gravity, collisions, and basic rigid-body physics.
- **Solar System Simulation:** Planets, moons, and orbital mechanics.
- **Real-time Rendering:** Built on Vulkan for high-performance GPU rendering.
- **Tools & Gameplay:** Pickaxes, building tools, and interactive environment mechanics.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Core Vulkan-based voxel engine
- [ ] Physics and collision system
- [ ] Procedural terrain generation
- [ ] Solar system simulation
- [ ] Lighting, shadows, and basic PBR materials
- [ ] Gameplay mechanics (building, mining, terraforming)
- [ ] Optimization and GPU performance improvements
- [ ] VR support (experimental)
